The Struggle is over!

Today we presented the learning we had made from creating (or trying to create) the PiVPN, a pretty straightforward slideshow.

After that we analyzed the implications of connecting to a VPN through the internet instead of directly from the local IP, and
how the former makes it less secure.

We then worked on IAs.
