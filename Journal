Today we started with some Coffee Script programming. I had been reluctant to install and use webstorm as I was already somewhat
comfortable with HTML and CSS. I decided to install it this class because it seemed like it would be easier to follow the rythm
of the class if i didn't have to translate from one language to the other. It turned out OK and I was able to have the project 
running before the end of the 20min

We then went on to try out a bit of writing similar to that which we'll do in the IB test, mostly in regards to how we respond
to command terms like: explain, evaluate, describe.
