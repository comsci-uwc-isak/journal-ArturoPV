Today we started learning some basic commands for the command line such as:
 1)cd
 2)ls (
 3)cat
 4)nano
 5)cp
 6)rm
 
 We then started to solve today's challenge, which was to build a program out of a flowchart Dr. Pinzon had written on the board
 in bash.
 
 In the meantime. Dr. Pinzon was having small interviews with each of the students check the status of everyone's IA's.
 
 At the end of the class Dr. Pinzon wrote the program on airplay, and said that the interviews would continue next class.
