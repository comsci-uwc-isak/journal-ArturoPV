After having destroyed the SD card, my computer managed to overheat the sd card reader (Woo!)
dr. Pinzon gave me a new card, I installed RPI on it and started working on getting the python code to work (and understand
how it would work) in the device.

To do list:

Device

1) Fix (get new) SD Card (DONE)
2) Re-install Rpi (DONE)

3) Work with python on the Raspberry pi to understand all the math needed for the conversion
4) Understand how the AD/DA board works so that I can connect the circuit to the raspberry
5) Re-create the circuit on a breadboard (old one was lost, but shouldn't take long)
6) How does the input reach the raspberry pi, how would that interact with the python script

Device to AWS

1) Re-install the IOT Core Packages
2) Have a succesful connection between the RPi and AWS IOT Core
3) Modify the script so that what's being sent is the output of the python script

AWS

1) Figure out if I need to change my RDS to Amazon's propietary Database structure because of the IOT CORE
  1.a) Do that if need be
