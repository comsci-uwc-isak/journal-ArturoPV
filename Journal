Today we went through the test, finished writting the aditional code needed for the 4.5 marks and worked on IA

I've decided to change the sstructure of the device once again, making now into a device that uses both the raspberry pi and the arduino,
as I can't qutie get the rPi to do the readings but there is already a library for arduino that does so.

To do list:

Device

1) Fix (get new) SD Card (DONE)
2) Re-install Rpi (DONE)
3) Change the OS to the modified version for readings (DONE BUT DIDN"T WORK)
4) Understand how the AD/DA board works so that I can connect the circuit to the raspberry (DONE BUT GOING TO TO USE ARDUINO FOR THIS PART)
5) Re-create the circuit on a breadboard (old one was lost, but shouldn't take long) (DONE)

6) How does the input reach the raspberry pi, how would that interact with the python script (I think I might use rednode)

Device to AWS

1) Re-install the IOT Core Packages
2) Have a succesful connection between the RPi and AWS IOT Core
3) Modify the script so that what's being sent is the output of the python script

AWS

1) Figure out if I need to change my RDS to Amazon's propietary Database structure because of the IOT CORE
  1.a) Do that if need be
