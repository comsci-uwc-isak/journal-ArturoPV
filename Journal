Today we struggled (still),

It's all documented on the slides, but essentially we tried debugging why it was that the PiVPN wasn't working.

We started by uninstalling ViVPN from the pi (but didnt uninstall all dependencies so that was mistake #1)
I then tried to re-install and lo an behold it wasn't quite working yet
It turned out two things were going wrong
  1) Eduardo was working on the same thing so we were basically clashing with each other
  2) The install wasnt clean so that was messy
We managed to figure these two things out, but then it was taking too long to generate the keys so we ended up having to shut down the pi

We also went over some of the concepts needed for the IA.
