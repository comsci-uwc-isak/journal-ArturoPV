Today we mostly revised some data structure, particularly, we worked with recursion. We got a pretty interesting excercise
which required us to divide a signal into two multiple times and then create an average out of the remaining signal.

To do list:

Device

1) Fix (get new) SD Card (DONE)
2) Re-install Rpi (DONE)

3) Change the OS to the modified version for readings
4) Understand how the AD/DA board works so that I can connect the circuit to the raspberry
5) Re-create the circuit on a breadboard (old one was lost, but shouldn't take long)
6) How does the input reach the raspberry pi, how would that interact with the python script

Device to AWS

1) Re-install the IOT Core Packages
2) Have a succesful connection between the RPi and AWS IOT Core
3) Modify the script so that what's being sent is the output of the python script

AWS

1) Figure out if I need to change my RDS to Amazon's propietary Database structure because of the IOT CORE
  1.a) Do that if need be
