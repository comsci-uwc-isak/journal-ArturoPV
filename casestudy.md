Collision Resistance: Collision resistance is the property of a hash function that it is computationally infeasible to find two colliding inputs. (https://link.springer.com/referenceworkentry/10.1007%2F0-387-23483-7_69). A hash function H is collision resistant if it is hard to find two inputs that hash to the same output; that is, two inputs a and b such that H(a) = H(b), and a â‰  b. (Goldwasser, S. and Bellare, M.
